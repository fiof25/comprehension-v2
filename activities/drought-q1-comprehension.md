# Question

How did the drought affect forests and other non-farming communities across Canada?

## Meta

- tag: Comprehension
- askedBy: Jamie and Thomas

## Themes

1. Wildfires alarming (tinder-dry / below-normal rainfall)
2. Scale e.g. 6.5M hectares
3. Fires affected farms, towns, rural/First Nations communities
4. Air quality deteriorated
5. Health risks (children, elderly, breathing)
6. Eastern Newfoundland
7. Bans and/or evacuations

## Character Positions

### Jamie

- opinion: "The drought affected crops like wheat, canola, and barley. People at the ranch faced barren pastures and sold off cattle, and turned to irrigation but due to scarce water supplies it became too expensive."
- status: RED

### Thomas

- opinion: "The drought affected forests by making trees dry and unhealthy, which caused problems for animals living there. It impacted non-farming communities because some people had to change their routines and deal with environmental challenges. Overall, the drought made life harder outside of farming areas as nature was damaged."
- status: RED

## Initial Messages

### Jamie

Hi! Thanks so much for helping us! I keep thinking about the poor dehydrated crops... but Thomas keeps shutting it down.

### Thomas

Jamie keeps mentioning farms, but I don't think that's relevant. I need some strong evidence. What did the reading say?
