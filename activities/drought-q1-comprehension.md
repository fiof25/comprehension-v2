# Question

How did the drought affect forests and other non-farming communities across Canada?

## Meta

- tag: Comprehension
- askedBy: Jamie and Thomas

## Themes

1. Wildfires alarming (tinder-dry / below-normal rainfall)
2. Scale e.g. 6.5M hectares
3. Fires affected farms, towns, rural/First Nations communities
4. Air quality deteriorated
5. Health risks (children, elderly, breathing)
6. Eastern Newfoundland
7. Bans and/or evacuations

## Character Positions

### Jamie

- opinion: "I keep thinking about the crops — wheat, canola, barley — all wiped out. And the ranchers had to sell off their cattle because the pastures were barren. They tried irrigation but water was too scarce and expensive."
- status: RED

### Thomas

- opinion: "I think the drought made the forests really dry and unhealthy, which must have been bad for wildlife. And people outside farming areas had to deal with environmental issues too. It seems like life got harder everywhere, not just on farms."
- status: RED

## Initial Messages

### Jamie

Hi! Thanks so much for helping us! I keep thinking about the poor dehydrated crops... but Thomas keeps shutting it down.

### Thomas

Jamie keeps mentioning farms, but I don't think that's relevant. I need some strong evidence. What did the reading say?

## Rubric

### Content
- level_1: Does not mention any non-farming impacts of the drought
- level_2: Mentions 1-2 impacts (e.g. wildfires OR air quality) with no detail
- level_3: Covers 3-4 impacts such as wildfires, air quality, evacuations, or health risks with some explanation
- level_4: Addresses 5-6 impacts including wildfires, air quality, health risks, community evacuations, and regional effects with clear detail
- level_5: Comprehensively covers all 7 themes — wildfires, scale (6.5M hectares), community impacts, air quality, health risks, Newfoundland effects, and bans/evacuations

### Understanding
- level_1: Response is incoherent or does not relate to the drought's non-farming effects
- level_2: Lists facts about the drought without explaining how they connect to non-farming communities
- level_3: Shows basic understanding of how the drought affected forests and communities beyond farming
- level_4: Demonstrates clear comprehension of the cascading effects from drought to wildfires to community health and displacement
- level_5: Synthesizes the interconnected nature of drought impacts — showing how dry conditions led to fires, which caused air quality issues, health crises, and community disruption

### Connections
- level_1: No links drawn between drought conditions and their downstream effects
- level_2: One vague connection (e.g. "drought caused fires")
- level_3: 2-3 cause-effect chains identified (e.g. drought → wildfires → evacuations)
- level_4: Multiple clear connections with reasoning (e.g. drought → dry forests → massive wildfires → air quality → health risks for vulnerable groups)
- level_5: Rich web of connections showing how drought, fire, air quality, health, geography, and policy responses are all interlinked

### Evidence
- level_1: No specific facts, numbers, or places from the reading cited
- level_2: 1-2 vague references (e.g. "lots of fires" without specifics)
- level_3: 3-4 specific details such as hectare figures, place names, or affected groups
- level_4: 5-6 precise details with context (e.g. "6.5 million hectares burned", "First Nations communities evacuated", "pregnant women and children at health risk")
- level_5: 7+ specific facts woven naturally into the argument including numbers (6.5M/6.8M hectares), places (Newfoundland, Prairies), affected groups (First Nations, children, elderly), and policy responses (bans)
