# Question

What similarities and differences did you notice between other regions droughts have affected and the Prairies?

## Meta

- tag: Comparison
- askedBy: Thomas

## Themes

1. Prairie-specific impacts (wheat, canola, barley, ranching, livestock sell-offs)
2. Ontario impacts (corn, soybean, maple/hardwood stress, lake/river levels)
3. Atlantic Canada impacts (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI, below-normal rainfall)
4. Newfoundland impacts (wildfires, evacuations, states of emergency)
5. Shared pattern: wildfires across multiple regions
6. Shared pattern: water scarcity affecting different sectors
7. Key difference: some Prairie areas got relief (late June rain) while others did not

## Character Positions

### Jamie

- opinion: "I remember the Prairies had it really bad — crops dying, ranchers selling cattle. I think the reading mentioned other places too but I'm not sure how they compare."
- status: RED

### Thomas

- opinion: "I know multiple regions were affected but the specific impacts varied. The Prairies focused on agriculture while other regions had different concerns. I need to think about what exactly was similar and different."
- status: RED

## Initial Messages

### Jamie

Oh this is a good one! I remember the Prairies had all those crop problems... but wait, didn't other places have issues too? I'm getting confused about what happened where!

### Thomas

Let's be precise about this. The reading covered several regions. What patterns did you notice across them?

## Rubric

### Content
- level_1: Does not compare any regions or only discusses one area
- level_2: Mentions 1-2 regions but does not identify similarities or differences
- level_3: Compares 2-3 regions (e.g. Prairies vs Ontario) with some similarities or differences noted
- level_4: Covers 4-5 regions with clear similarities and differences between Prairie impacts and other areas
- level_5: Comprehensively compares all major regions (Prairies, Ontario, Atlantic Canada, Newfoundland) with specific similarities and differences for each

### Understanding
- level_1: Response is incoherent or does not address regional comparison
- level_2: Lists regional facts without comparing or contrasting them
- level_3: Shows basic understanding of how drought affected different regions differently
- level_4: Demonstrates clear understanding of both shared patterns (wildfires, water scarcity) and region-specific impacts
- level_5: Synthesizes the comparison to show why the same drought produced different effects in different regions based on geography and economy

### Connections
- level_1: No connections drawn between regions or impacts
- level_2: One vague similarity or difference stated
- level_3: 2-3 comparisons made (e.g. both Prairies and Ontario lost crops, but different types)
- level_4: Multiple clear parallels and contrasts with reasoning (e.g. water scarcity affected farming in Prairies but forestry in Ontario)
- level_5: Rich comparative analysis showing interconnected patterns — how the same drought stress manifested differently based on regional conditions

### Evidence
- level_1: No specific facts, numbers, or places from the reading
- level_2: 1-2 vague references without regional specifics
- level_3: 3-4 region-specific details (e.g. wheat in Prairies, corn in Ontario)
- level_4: 5-6 precise details with regional context (e.g. "77% of Prairie farmland affected", "corn and soybean yields dropped in Ontario")
- level_5: 7+ specific facts across multiple regions including percentages, crop types, place names, and quantified impacts
